### Content

- ***euclids.cpp:*** A simple greatest common denominator algorithm that runs recursively. 
- ***nminusone.cpp:*** Basically euclid's algorithm, however it subtracts one from the first element input based on if a GCD is found before reaching 1 as the GCD. (i.e. If GCD = 1, subtract one from n and rerun)
- ***Makefile:*** A file to compile, run, and clean the code. 
    - 'make' to compile the code.
    - 'make run-euc' to run the compiled euclids code
    - 'make run-nmin' to run the euclids code with the subtraction based on GCD number.
